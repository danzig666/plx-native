/// **The surface's logical state covers its inner stack — the whole reason phase 5b re-pinned
/// `state_fp` and invalidated every committed replay fixture.** `Dispatcher::state_hash` folds
/// in exactly `screen.state().hash()` per surface, so with the ceremony alone in there (which
/// is what `SurfaceState` wrote until 2026-09-07) every press anywhere inside Settings,
/// Privacy, Legal and first-run Favourites hashed identically and a replay could never report
/// `DIVERGED`.
///
/// **What this test grades is the STACK half and nothing else, and the distinction is the one
/// the old wording lost.** It opens a page and watches the hash move, which proves the fold
/// reaches the bodies at all. It says nothing whatever about whether a given body's own
/// `state()` writes enough to tell two of ITS frames apart — the sentence here used to add
/// that the finer half "rides in through each body's own `state().hash()`", which is a
/// mechanism dressed as a guarantee, and a verifier refuted it by scrolling a Legal document
/// with the hash standing still. That half is each page's test to write, in each page's own
/// file; the `LogicalState` impl above carries the census of who currently does.
